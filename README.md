# Credit-Score Project
### Problem statement
* Over the years, a global finance company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts
* Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score
*   We downloaded the data [Credit Score Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification) from Kaggle
